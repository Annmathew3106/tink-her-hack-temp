Project Description
CampusConnect is a web-based college portal that helps students share doubts, report lost and found items, and view important announcements in one place, improving campus communication.

Problem Statement
Students often miss important information and struggle to get quick help because doubts, notices, and lost items are scattered across different platforms or offline methods.

The Solution
CampusConnect provides a centralized, easy-to-use platform where students can post doubts, interact through comments, report lost and found items, and stay updated with campus announcements.
